This exercise introduces the Fork/Join framework in Java,
which is designed for solving problems that can be broken into smaller subproblems and solved in parallel.

We’ll count how many prime numbers are in a given range (e.g., 1–100,000) using a divide-and-conquer approach:

Split the range into halves (LeftTask and RightTask) until the range is small enough. (base case)

Solve one of the tasks asynchronously.

Combine results from subtasks to get the total.
